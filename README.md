# algorithms
Own C++ implementations of various algorithms and data structures. 

Primarily used during my high school years as a competitive programming toolbox, leading up to [IOI 2015](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/5735). Stopped actively maintaining the repo and adding content afterwards.
