# algorithms
- My implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. I have used this repository during my high school years as a collection of everything I know regarding algorithms and data structures. It helped a lot in algorithmic competitions, and ultimately helped me win a medal on IOI. 
- Since the repo was built over the course of four years it contained some poorly written, non-standardized code. I am currently taking time to refactor everything, and make it usable again, for future endeavours ([ACM](https://icpc.baylor.edu/), [GCJ](https://code.google.com/codejam), [FHC](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/)...)
