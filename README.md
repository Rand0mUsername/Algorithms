# algorithms
- My implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. I have used this repository during my high school years as a collection of everything (or most of the things) I know in this field. It helped a lot in algorithmic competitions, and ultimately helped me win a medal on IOI. 
- Since this repository was built over the course of four years it contained some poorly written, non-standardized code. I ~~am currently taking~~ took some time to refactor everything, and make it usable again, for future endeavours ([ACM](https://icpc.baylor.edu/), [GCJ](https://code.google.com/codejam), [FHC](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/)...).
- The codes are still mainly written for my personal usage, but if you find them useful feel free to steal them or contact me if you need any help or want to discuss a particular implementation. They mostly contain test interfaces, and test problems from [SPOJ](spoj.com) (where applicable). The test problems are meant to be simple, and their only purpose is to verify the quality of a single implementation.
- If you spot any mistakes, have any suggestions (possibly regarding test problems), or find an error please let me know :)
