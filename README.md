# algorithms
- My implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. I was using this repository during my high school years as a collection of everything (or most of the things) I know in this field. It helped a lot in algorithmic competitions, and ultimately helped me win a medal on IOI. 
- Since this repository was built over the course of four years it contained some poorly written, non-standardized code. I took some time to refactor everything, and make it usable again, for future endeavours ([ACM](https://icpc.baylor.edu/), [GCJ](https://code.google.com/codejam), [FHC](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/)...).
- The implementations are still there mainly for my personal usage, but you are allowed to use them without permission. Also, feel free to contact me if you need any help or want to discuss a particular implementation. 
- If you spot any mistakes, have any suggestions, or find an error please let me know :)
